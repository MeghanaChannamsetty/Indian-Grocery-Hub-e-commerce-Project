# Indian Grocery Hub e-commerce 
 
Our team embarked on developing the Indian Grocery Hub, an E-Commerce platform catering specifically to Indian groceries in Mt. Pleasant. The aim was to provide a convenient way for locals and students to order groceries online. We developed key features such as online ordering, delivery scheduling, payment on delivery, and inventory management. Additionally, we implemented zip code restrictions and offered free delivery for orders above a certain amount. This resulted in a fully functional platform tailored to the Indian community's needs.
